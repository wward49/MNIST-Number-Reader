Supervised machine learning using sklearn library in python.

This was a very fun learning project I did to dip my toes into Machine Learning. I learned a butt load...and I was able to familiarize myself with new terms/ideas. 
The model gets an image and grayscales it. It splits the image into an 8x8 grid and assigns a value to each grid that represents the average amount of darkness in that area. Random biasis and initial guesses are given, and the the program runs through many epochs, slowly adjusting its guesses to be more accurate over time.
